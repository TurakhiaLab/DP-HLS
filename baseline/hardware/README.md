#### System Requirements
1. Python 3
2. Icarus Verilog
3. GTKWave

#### Clone DP-HLS Repository
Cloning DP-HLS clones the baseline repositories required (see Baseline Tools section)
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TurakhiaLab/DP-HLS.git
cd DP-HLS/baseline/hardware
```

#### Running the Baseline


#### Baseline Tools
We have used [GACT](https://github.com/yatisht/darwin/tree/master), [BSW](https://github.com/gsneha26/Darwin-WGA), and [SquiggleFilter](https://github.com/TimD1/SquiggleFilter) as our baselines. Cloning the repository above will clone GACT, BSW, and SquiggleFilter repositories, including their RTL code.
